### Hi, I'm Jade

I got my first taste of problem-solving when I successfully saved my computer from the infamous blue screen of death. Since then, I've spent hours developing applications and solving problems I encounter in the real world and within my code. While I often found myself torn between developing mobile applications and web applications, who says I can't do both? Consequently, I'm seeking a role in frontend and backend development, and/or Android development, utilizing the MERN stack for web development and Kotlin for Android development. 

Since you're here, ask me about the mobile app SCODD!
